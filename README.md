This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Built for the freeCodeCamp Front End Libraries certificate, this pomodoro clock was styled after Hubert Farnsworth's (a fictional character) "death clock" from the animated comedy Futurama ("A big piece of garbage" season 1, episode 8).

The initial project in App.js has code written to correct for time drift. This caused some issues with the testing. The javascript in App2.js takes a somewhat different approach to the timer, leaves out the time correction and clears the tests.
